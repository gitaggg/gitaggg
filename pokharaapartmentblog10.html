    <h2>1. Determine Your Budget</h2>
    <p>The first step in selecting an apartment is to determine your budget. Consider how much you are willing to spend on rent each month and factor in additional costs like utilities and maintenance.</p>

    <h2>2. Choose the Right Location</h2>
    <p>Location plays a critical role in finding the right apartment. Do you want to be close to tourist attractions, restaurants, or schools? Areas like Lakeside offer great access to amenities but may come at a higher price.</p>

    <h2>3. Check the Amenities</h2>
    <p>Consider what amenities are important to you. Do you need a gym, parking, or Wi-Fi? Many modern apartments offer such amenities, so think about what would enhance your lifestyle.</p>

    <h2>4. Evaluate the Safety and Security</h2>
    <p>Safety is a top priority when choosing an apartment. Check if the building has adequate security measures such as CCTV surveillance, a security guard, and a gated entrance to ensure your peace of mind.</p>

    <h2>5. Inspect the Condition of the Apartment</h2>
    <p>Before signing any lease, make sure to thoroughly inspect the apartment. Check the condition of plumbing, electrical systems, windows, and doors to ensure everything is in working order.</p>

    <h2>6. Consider Proximity to Work or School</h2>
    <p>If you have a job or attend school in Pokhara, consider how close the apartment is to your workplace or educational institution. Choosing a place with a short commute will save you time and energy.</p>
